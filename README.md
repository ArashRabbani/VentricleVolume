Image-based estimation of the heart ventricular volume using deep learning and Gaussian process

In this repository, an image-based method has been developed to estimate the volume of the heart ventricles cavity using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging data. Deep machine learning and the Gaussian process have been applied to bring the estimations closer to the values manually measured. The included example data is from ACDC challenge for disease diagnostic and segmentation of heart images ([Link](https://acdc.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/)).
